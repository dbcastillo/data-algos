# Data Structures and Algorithms

  ## App Notes
    * To get started with the homepage, minimally we need a controller and a view

    * `rails g controller Welcome index`
      - this gives us the controller and view files
    * replace index.html.erb file with `<h1>Hello, Rails!</h1>`
      - this gives us something to work with now
